# Document Stamp and Signature Expertise System

## Overview

This repository contains scripts and notebooks for the development of a document stamp and signature expertise system. The system includes functionalities for extracting stamps and signatures from document images, separating stamps from signatures in overlapped images, and providing a graphical user interface (GUI) for interaction.

## Contents

1. `extract.py`: Functions for extracting stamps and signatures from document images.
2. `separate.py`: Algorithms to separate stamps from signatures in overlapped images.
3. `interface.py`: GUI for interacting with the system.
4. `Methods for signature verification.ipynb`: Notebook providing classifier methods for signature verification.
5. `Methods for stamp verification.ipynb`: Notebook providing classifier methods for stamp verification.


## Datasets

- **Signature Verification Dataset:** Data is located in the "signature_data" folder.
- **Stamp Verification Dataset:** Data is located in the "stamp_data" folder.
